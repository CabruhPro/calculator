A fully functional TI-108  
  
Has all the features that the original elementary school calculator has, including:
  
- Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
- Entering automatic constant for all four operations (e.g. pushing 2 + 3 = will give 5, then pushing 4 = will perform 4+3, giving 7.)
- Viewing percents, square roots and negative numbers
- Three-key memory (MRC, M-, M+)
- Clearing last entry and/or all entries
